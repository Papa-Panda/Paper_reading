A few thoughts on Universal Scalability Law
from https://chatgpt.com/c/6816c505-9adc-800e-b97a-795ae3c9dcb9
1/ Major problems it helps to understand
1.1 using utilization to predict workload
because utilization is almost linear with concurrency (= QPS * avg latency)
(assuming avg latency does not vary much)

1.2 using utilization to predict latency
accurate when predicting avg latency
useful when predicting P99 latency
(need an empirical obseravtion of latency distribution)

1.3 using utilization to predict others like error percentage
similar to P99 latency (see 1.2)
(need an empirical obseravtion of latency vs error percentage)
how to understand error percentage? Due to saturation etc

2/ USL is just a tool to understand the pattern; 
It can help feature engineering; but best to predict using pure ML tools
